# True-Random-Number-Generator
Hardware-using reverse biased transistor

In the cryptography world, choosing a sequence of random numbers is vital. Considering the proper functioning of systems, there must be an unpredictable secret key. A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a primary part used in various applications including cryptographic algorithms, communication systems, simulations, etc. It is critical to be able to produce fully unpredictable and unbiased bits with high security to cost-effective ratio. In this project, a simpler and cost-effective TRNG based on reverse biased transistors, producing avalanche noise, further amplified and digitized by Schmitt trigger is presented. Which in turn is interfaced with Arduino for converting digital signal to binary digits and visualising it on serial monitor. The advantage of this hardware TRNG is that it is constructed from existing components with no extra circuitry using a high-quality entropy source, avalanche noise. The randomness of the bits generated by hardware TRNG were assessed and tested by applying the Correlation Test using an indigenous algorithm in python which indicates the unpredictability and non-repeatability of the data. Given its strong results, it is believed that it has a potential for cryptographic applications.
